# Earthling

# Project overview

Greetings! We are the Earthlings, and this is our project to help save the only planet we have. As well as featuring a calendar with ideas of what you can do to help the earth each month, our site features a blog with the ability for users to log in to the site to contribute ideas, tips, and conversations that help keep the world turning. Users might visit this site for several reasons: to learn this month's promoted tip; to share ideas, thoughts and inspirations with other users; and to discuss these things. As such, the site features the ability to create an account, log in and out, and post from an account; the site also features authentication to securely facilitate this.
